# HRO Project Analysis 

### Description

This code pulls down relevant HRO project data from the Immutable X chain found here: https://immutascan.io/address/0x8cb332602d2f614b570c7631202e5bf4bb93f3f6?chartTab=TradeVolume


### What's the point? 

Unlike the f2p space, web3 has a dearth of central analytics reporting. It can be difficult to understand how chains are performing, let alone specific projects. I found this particular project interesting because it's taking a known commodity (comics) and listing it on the open market. While their might be new games in the future that shows how to best make use of this tech, I believe it will be the companies that already have existing brands that will best leverage web3. 



### Future Development Ideas 

1. Database integration 
2. Analysis across a large cross section of data 
3. Combining data with ETH-USD conversion 
4. Automating code execution (cron, EC2 instance, etc.)
